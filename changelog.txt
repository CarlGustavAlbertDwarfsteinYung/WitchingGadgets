- Travelling Gear dependency has been removed
- Primordial Weapons and Cloak of Voluminous Pockets had to be disabled because it depended on Travelling Gear special activation Key
- Primordial Weapons are now activated on Shift+Use
- Spectral Cloak will work automatically when worn and cannot be enabled/disabled like before
- all WG Travelling Gear baubles are equipped as regular Baubles
- Terrestrial transformer has an additional Magical Forest focus
- Most titles have been removed
- fixed bag duplication bug
- Gauntlet can now pick up custom Aura Nodes (ex Gadomancy)
- Spinning Wheel has been disabled (didn't have much use, recipes moved to arcane workbench, is still in the game just not available)
I may re-enable this if I can come up with new fabrics.
- Ring of the Sniper has been fixed
- Cloak of the Raven feels incredibly smooth and fun to use
- Seraph Shoulder double jumping can no longer be spammed by holding Jump and feels better and has higher jump
- added new ores like Octine, Syrmorite
- gem effects have been improved and expanded, BOP gems supported, Gauntlet effects also adjusted to match
- the idea was to make point cut more aggressive and oval cut more utility (earth being the only exception to this rule)
    - point cut
        - fire: use = damage boost (used to place a temp light), added shift+use = set target on fire
        - water: use = same as before turns lava->obsidian and water->ice but no longer turns flowing lava to cobble
        - earth: use = same as before knockback resistance plus added also regular resistance, effects last longer
        - entropy: use = changed to add night vision and warp (used to only give warp)
    - oval cut
        - fire: use = places a number of random temporary lights (used to block projectiles)
        - order: use = just as before teleports but it has been slightly tweaked
- note: with the above changes Gauntlet can be incredibly strong late game melee weapon in conjunction with fire and earth point gems
- re-enabled a previously disabled block Frost Extruder which produces snowballs (also fixed the model to look nice)
- added Soulbound enchantment (from KryptonMaster)
- "[WG]" has been removed from all entries
- added Scarecrow Golem, a vanilla like Golem that looks like a scarecrow skeleton with a pumpkin head, that can be given weapons to fight with
- added back all the armors and cloack of voluminous pockets but they don't work properly just yet

Thaumcraft Addon for those that still crave more content 

Basically just more stuff to add to Thaumcraft. I've been working on this since 1.6.4, finally feel comfortable with doing a beta release ^^

This is an unofficial build of Witching Gadgets that does not use Travelers Gear. Special weapons use Shift + Right click for special activation and Spaulders, Kama, Cloak, Vambraces are worn in Baubles slot. All armors have been disabled (for now).

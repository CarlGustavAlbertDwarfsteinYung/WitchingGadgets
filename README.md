Thaumcraft Addon for those that still crave more content 

Basically just more stuff to add to Thaumcraft. I've been working on this since 1.6.4, finally feel comfortable with doing a beta release ^^

This is an unofficial build of Witching Gadgets that does not use Travelers Gear. Weapons and items that used to use Traveller's Gear activation know now use Shift+Right click instead. Armors and Cloak of Voluminous pockets has been disabled for now.
